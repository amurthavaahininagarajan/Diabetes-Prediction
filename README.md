# Diabetes-Prediction
# Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on various health-related features. Early identification of potential diabetes cases can aid in timely intervention and management, contributing to better healthcare outcomes.
# Dataset:
The project will leverage a dataset containing relevant health metrics such as glucose levels, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), insulin levels, and other factors associated with diabetes. The dataset will be carefully curated and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data quality.
# Technologies:
The project will be implemented using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib. Jupyter Notebooks will be employed for interactive development and documentation.
# Expected Outcome:
The outcome of this project is a reliable and accurate diabetes prediction model that can be used as a screening tool for individuals at risk. The model's performance will be rigorously assessed against established metrics, and the project will be well-documented to facilitate future reference and collaboration in the healthcare domain.
